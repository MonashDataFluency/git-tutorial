Maintain a linear history for a file or group of files.\r\n2. Use branches effectively to group related changes together, as well as\r\n   maintain parallel versions.\r\n3. Use branches and pull-requests to collaborate effectively.\r\n\r\nIt took me a long time to pass all three, and I hope this tutorial will help\r\nsomeone get there faster.\r\n\r\n# What is Git and why do you want it?\r\n\r\nGit is a _revision control management system_[^git][^gitbook]. It helps you\r\nkeep track of changes to your files. You've probably had the following thing\r\nhappen to you before:\r\n\r\n![PhD Comics:\r\nFinal.doc](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)\r\n\r\nI certainly have:\r\n\r\n![Revision hell](images/revhell.png)\r\n\r\nNotice:\r\n\r\n- Different versions of the same document have different filenames.\r\n- The date and author of a change are encoded haphazardly in the filename.\r\n- Serial edits by different authors are concatenated in the filename, with no\r\n  indication as to whose edit came first.\r\n- These are just five files in one directory; other revisions are probably\r\n  scattered around my various hard drives and as email attachments.\r\n\r\nThis is known as _revision hell_, and it happens when you don't use revision\r\ncontrol, even if you are working alone. Systems such as git save you from this.\r\n\r\nClick on the sections below to get started with git!\r\n\r\n- [Git theory](theory.md)\r\n- [Working with git](working.md)\r\n- [Working with GitHub](github.md)\r\n- [Advanced topics](advanced.md)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[^git]: http://git-scm.com/ The Git homepage.
